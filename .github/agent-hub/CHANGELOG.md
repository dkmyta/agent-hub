# Changelog

What changed in each release of the agent hub, newest first. Each entry says
what a repository has to do when updating to it, under **Updating**
("Nothing" when it's just a file update). How to update:
[docs/updating.md](docs/updating.md).

## 1.0.0 — 2026-10-02

The first release.

- Stages: **work order** (an intake ticket → a structured work order, or back
  for details) and **implementation plan** (an approved work order → a
  technical plan attached to the ticket, or back with questions), each with an
  expert review, scoped `/revise` revisions and reverse paths.
- Tracker: **Jira**. GitHub Projects: setup foundations and the intake form;
  its stages aren't connected yet.
- Agent runner: **Claude Code**, read-only and isolated; session files
  removed after every run.
- Repository extensions per stage (`.github/agent-hub-extensions/`).
- Install and update script, tests, evals and docs.

**Updating:** first install — follow [docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md).
